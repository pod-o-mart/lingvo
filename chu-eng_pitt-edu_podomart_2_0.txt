Old Church Slavonic Dictionary
University of Pittsburgh

The OCS Dictionary is based on Oscar E. Swan’s Old Church Slavic Glossary (Oakland: Berkeley Slavic Specialties, 2008). As noted in the introduction to that work, it was compiled from glossaries by Diels, Lunt, Vaillant, and Whitfield, with most proper names and vocabulary to Codex Suprasliensis being drawn from Blagovoj.
