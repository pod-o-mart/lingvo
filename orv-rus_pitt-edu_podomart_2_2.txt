Древнерусский словарь
Old Russian Dictionary
University of Pittsburgh

The OR Dictionary is a lightly version of Horace G. Lunt’s out-of-print and not easily available Concise Dictionary of Old Russian, 11th-17th Centuries, München: Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 1970). This skeletal glossary is precisely a “bridge” dictionary, between MR and OCS. It is especially strong in the presentation of ethnic, cultural, and religious terms unknown to either OCS or MR. The meanings of most everyday OR words will need to be sought among the definitions of similar or identical words in OCS or MR.
